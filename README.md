# DriveCrypt

## Introduction

An experimental drive encryption utility, along with a custom Win32 framework. Built for my own fun and education, so don't go thinking it's something you can use for production!

## Status

__Archived.__ This project is no longer being actively developed. The encryption function was never achieved and this project ended up just being a GUI framework for Win32. Most of its ideas have been absorbed into the Onyx32 framework.
